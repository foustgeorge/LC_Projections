# A DataJoint based pipeline for analysis of sleep recording in rodents together with fiber photometry data.

This code included different functions which can be used to analysis sleep recordings (EEG and EMG data) combied in fiber photometry measuremnents. In the current example the photometry recordings are conducted in the locus coeruleus (LC) of the mouse brain. 

For more information regarding DataJoint and how to set it up locally, the documentation can be found here:
